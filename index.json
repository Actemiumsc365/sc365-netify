A unique identifier in a barcode (RFID) form for a given handling unit – commonly a pallet that is used to track that handling unit throughout its lifecycle. What is License plating? License plating is a method for grouping and managing inventory in the form of a container. You decide what constitutes a container - a pallet, product carton, truck, or ocean freight box can all be a container. Each container is assigned a unique License Plate Number (LPN) and given a barcode label or RFID tag. In SupplyChain365 we use License Plate for the following issues: Order: we use it for any sales or purchase order in the business central (Quote, return order, order, etc.) Parent: we use a parent License Plate above other License plates in the hierarchy. Child: we use child license plates inside parent license plates in the hierarchy. Mutation: we use mutation to put stock on a license plate, you must do this with a mutation order. click here to see the tutorial.
